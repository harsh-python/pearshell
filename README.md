# pearshell
A New Python Shell By Harshbir Singh.
In This Shell you can do same things as in python's default shell.
But if you are making functions or for loops,while loops you have to make indentation by you self by tab key on your keyboard...
GOTO THE BRANCH 'version1.3_BETA' IT HAS THE PYTHON EDITOR BUILD IN IT....
Happy Coding.....
